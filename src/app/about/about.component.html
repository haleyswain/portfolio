      <h3> Hi, Im Haley </h3>
      <p>
        I'm a doodle mom, bagel enthusiast, and programmer-in-training currently residing in the Silicon Forest. My roots come from the plains of Montana, where I grew up with a love and passion for everything outdoors. </p>
      <p> Today, I am enthusiastic about learning. Continuous improvement is my mantra, and I can't wait to see where the next adventure takes me!</p>
